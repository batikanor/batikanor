Hey,
I've been doing too many things, so I stopped listing some of my repositories here.
To see some of my past projects, check my [cv](https://batikanor.com/cv/en). For detailed info regarding respective projects, check my [portfolio website](https://www.batikanor.com) or my cv's [attachments](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1F9SfO9KmnlkZb7yZJAadQJgdEckByJGIfNrN3qaaGFU/edit). If that's not enough, feel free to go through my public repositories on github.

Have a wonderful day
